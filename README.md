## Project Overview

The goal of this microsite is to make climate action visible and motivating by enabling students, professionals, and community members to commit to eco-friendly habits. It features:

- A hero section with a call-to-action.
- Live key performance indicators (KPIs) showing pledge progress.
- A clear form to submit personalized pledges.
- Instant digital certificate generation based on user commitments.
- A public pledge wall showing recent pledge entries.
- Privacy-conscious design keeping user contact info secure.

This project is built using simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The backend is simulated locally using JavaScript arrays for demonstration.
